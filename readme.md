# Stack Overflow Clone

## Introduction

Now that we've had a look at some more complex use cases with React, it's over to you!

Your task is to build out a simple "Stack Overflow" clone using React components.

There's no server side code here, so all of the data should be held in the `App` components `state`.

## Exercise

Build out a simple React app that allows a user to:

- add new question with rating
- sort questions by rating both ASC and DESC
- increment/decrement rating for each question

## Bonus ideas

- Pimp the Stackoverflow Clone with some styling
- Add comments to questions

##Tips

- When updating state, be sure not to mutate your previous state
- Check notes for immutable sort
